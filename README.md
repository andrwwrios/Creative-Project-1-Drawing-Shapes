# Creative-Project-1-Drawing-Shapes
The main file in this project is the TurtleShapes.java file and the supporting one is Turtle.java.
For this project the main objective was to demonstrate my ability to Write a for loop, write a nested for loop, call a library method,
and read the documentation of a Java library to figure out how to call a formerly unknown method.
